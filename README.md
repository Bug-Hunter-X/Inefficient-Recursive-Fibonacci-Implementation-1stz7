# Inefficient Recursive Fibonacci

This repository demonstrates an inefficient recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence and provides a more efficient solution.  The original recursive approach suffers from overlapping subproblems, leading to exponential time complexity.  The improved solution uses dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
